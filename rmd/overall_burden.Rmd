# Overall Disease Burden

```{r}
# Load necessary packages
pacman::p_load(tidyverse, knitr, here)

# Import the overall disease data
data_overall <- read_csv(here("data", "burden-of-disease-all-causes.csv"))
```

## Table of Estimates for Overall Disease Burden Over Time


```{r}
# Here render a table for the DALY burden over time for the three countries 
# You should pivot the data to show each country in a separate column.
# Use kable() from the knitr package to render the table.

data1 <- data_overall %>% 
  filter(Entity %in% c("Canada", "Switzerland", "South Africa")) %>% 
  select(Entity, Year, `DALYs (Disability-Adjusted Life Years) - All causes - Sex: Both - Age: Age-standardized (Rate)`) %>% 
  pivot_wider(names_from = Entity, values_from = `DALYs (Disability-Adjusted Life Years) - All causes - Sex: Both - Age: Age-standardized (Rate)`)

kable(data1)
```

## Plot Showing Trends in Overall Disease Burden Over Time

```{r}
# Here, plot a line graph showing the trend of DALY burden for the chosen countries over time. You can use ggplot2 to create this plot. Each country's line should be a different color.

data1 %>% 
  pivot_longer(cols = 2:4, names_to = "Countries", values_to = "DALY") %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = Year, y = log(DALY), color = Countries)) +
  geom_line()
```

DALY for Canada and Switzerland are quite the same but South Affrica make a significant difference. In 2005, there was a pick
